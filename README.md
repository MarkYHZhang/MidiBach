Midi play(Bach) ðŸ˜‰ visualizer ðŸŒˆ + midi recorder ðŸŽ¤ for the piano keyboard ðŸŽ¹


## Why?
As a pianist myself I've always wanted to visualize my playing especially after seeing thsoe videos using Synthesia-style MIDI player to playback their performance. But being a big fan of open source and also for sake of finding something to do during these quaratine days, I've decided to create it myself.

## Plans
- [ ] Prettier buttons
- [ ] Custom colours for the keys
- [ ] Custom background support
