# MidiBach
Midi play(Bach) ðŸ˜‰ visualizer ðŸŒˆ + midi recorder ðŸŽ¤ for the piano keyboard ðŸŽ¹


## Why?
As a pianist myself I've always wanted to visualize my playing especially after seeing thsoe videos using Synthesia-style MIDI player to playback their performance. But being a big fan of open source and also for sake of finding something to do during these quaratine days, I've decided to create it myself.

This project is sort of an exploration project of an even bigger project that is work-in-progress -- (A MIDI sequencer)

## How?
The goal of this project is really for me to understand how to process MIDI from the ground up (working with byte arrays ðŸ˜•), decoding/encoding/editing MIDI without the help of external libraries. Yea I guess I'm also doing graphics from scratch (might've been a bad idea ðŸ˜…).

Note: I'm bit of a purist, in case you haven't seen my 3D game that was built with no external libraries -> [Pather](https://github.com/MarkYHZhang/Pather).

## Plans
- [x] Active rendering, to prevent graphic jitters
- [ ] Handle multiple dynamic changes
- [ ] Prettier buttons
- [ ] Custom colours for the keys
- [ ] Custom background support
- [ ] Pedal support
