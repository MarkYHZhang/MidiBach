# MidiBach
Midi play(Bach) ðŸ˜‰ visualizer ðŸŒˆ + midi recorder ðŸŽ¤ for the piano keyboard ðŸŽ¹


## Why?
As a pianist myself I've always wanted to visualize my playing especially after seeing thsoe videos using Synthesia-style MIDI player to playback their performance. But being a big fan of open source and also for sake of finding something to do during these quaratine days, I've decided to create it myself.

This project is sort of an exploration project of an even bigger project that is work-in-progress -- (A MIDI sequencer)

## Plans
- [ ] Active rendering, to prevent graphic jitters
- [ ] Prettier buttons
- [ ] Custom colours for the keys
- [ ] Custom background support
